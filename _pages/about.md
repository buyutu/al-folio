## About me
I earned my Ph.D. from [UConn](https://uconn.edu/) in transportation engineering and planning. I am driven by lofty ideals, helping other people to live a harmonious life through urban transportation research. I enjoy exploring urban transportation issues such as street design, road safety, and transport policy, from a perspective of sustainability, equity, and humanity. My 5+ years' experience as a transportation engineering researcher equips me with interdisciplinary and systemic thinking including urban planning, geography, and data science. I have demonstrated my skills in quantitative methods, scientific communication, and data visualization.

I have a deep passion in applying data-driven approaches to tackle problems in pedestrian & bicycle safety from perspectives of sustainability, equity, and humanity.

### Personal Life
In my free time, I love [taking photos](https://ge-photograph.github.io/), traveling, food, and playing basketball. Recently, I am into time-lapse photography and flying my Drone. I have a [Osmo Action 4](https://dji.com/osmo-action-4) to cpature videos in motion (hiking, biking, citywalk)
